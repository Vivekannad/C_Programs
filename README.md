# C Projects

Welcome to the C Projects repository! This repository contains various C programming projects, each demonstrating different aspects and functionalities of the C language. Each project is organized into its own directory.

## Projects

### SNAKE_GAME
A classic snake game implemented in C. The game includes features such as:
- Moving the snake using `w`, `a`, `s`, `d` keys.
- Growing the snake when it eats the fruit.
- Ending the game when the snake hits the boundary or its own tail.
- Dynamic speed increase as the score increases.
